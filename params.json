I have used it to sens the Water level on my overhead tank.  The receiver on the other end connected to a stepper motor to deflect a needle to show the continuous level sensing on a scale of High-Half-Low-Empty.\r\n\r\n##Here is what i used:\r\nUltrasonic sensor - 1\r\nRF transmitter - 1\r\nBattery - 2\r\n","google":"UA-66084419-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
